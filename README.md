## What is PICO-8?

> [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a [fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq) for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. It feels like a regular console, but runs on Windows / Mac / Linux. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a commandline, a suite of cartridge creation tools, and an online cartridge browser called **SPLORE**.

The harsh limitations of PICO-8 are carefully chosen to be fun to work with, to encourage small but expressive designs, and to give cartridges made with PICO-8 their own particular look and feel.

The limitations are really the beauty of PICO-8. It keeps your projects from collapsing under their own weight allowing you to focus on the core game.

## Things

- **Clock** it's a clock with both analog and digital readout. This was a fun project working with circles of the analog portion
- **Mines** A Mine Sweeper demake. It kind of works, it's ugly. A few good nuggets in there
- **Mines 2** A Mine Sweeper demake again. Using the good parts of the first and adding multiple progressive levels. It's still ugly.
- **Cannon** A failed attempt at a Kitten Cannon
- **Jones** A failed attempt at a "Jones in the Fast Lane" demake
- **IT Slug** A game about tech support hell. Garbage.
- **Cave Diver** From the [tutorial](https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-pico-8-issue1)
